# Better-and-HARDER-Flappy-Bird
![alt text](stuff/thing.jpg)
## Description
This is a little Flappy Bird type game I made using pygame via Pycharm. What makes it special to me is the fact that thi is technically the first game I've made. It doesn't have a lot of features or any really visually appealing elements, but I've put my time into it and as beginner in coding with an experience of probably 2 months (started computer science 5 months ago but the actual time spent on it was not 5 months), I feel pretty confident with this first game, I hope you all like it! **I WILL KEEP UPDATING THIS GAME SINCE IT IS MY FIRST ONE AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD MORE FUN FEATURES!**
## Installation
Still trying to figure that out, seeking help with the HackClub staffs hopefully could resolve this issue soon. 
## How to play
There are instructions in the game and it was shown in the video. 
- Use arrow keys to move the plane.
- Avoid obstacles such as the fighter jets and buildings.
Pretty simple stuff right?
## What's included in the game
Right now there aren't a lot of features just yet, I've tried to include power-ups and more dynamic phases but it was really messing my code up so I had to stick with the more stable version. 
- Basically there's a dark phase that randomly spawns in, make sure you get ready!
- This game is pretty hard as spawns are random so let's just say sometimes you run into dead ends hehe. It's done on purpose so it's more like a luck game for high scores. 
- I've included a friend of ours in this game! Survive for a certain amount of time to meet him.
## Credits
Thanks to my friend Henry for making the very prototype of this project shout out to him.
